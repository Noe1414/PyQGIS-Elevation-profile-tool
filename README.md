# Elevation profile tool

**WARNING : This code has to be run with the QGIS Python console. An error will occur if the code is runned outside the application**

The purpose of this code is to create an elevation profile figure just by using a shapefile. 
The API used to get the elevation is from the IGN (Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière).
As a consequence, **this elevation profile tool will only work with shapefile data from France**.
